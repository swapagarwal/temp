There is a glitch in the matrix and the Oracle may not say the truth always. Deus ex machina’s hand is seen in this. In this game, Majority exists but Neo must take into account Oracle’s lies.

Neo is allowed to ask the same question, pick any 2 balls from a set of N balls and ask Oracle if they are the same or not. If they are of the same color, the Oracle answers YES and if they are not, Oracle answers NO but Oracle lies exactly L times in the game if played long enough.

Input Format

First line contains 5 single space separated characters/Integers.

1st is N which is the cardinality of the balls set.
2nd is 0 indicating that majority exists.
3rd is an integer L indicating the number of times Oracle might lie.
4th is the integer 2 indicating that the balls are of 2 colors only.
5th is an integer 1 indicating the oracle lies exactly L times

Second line is an integer D, D lines follow. Each line shows all your previous questions to Oracle. Each question is of the format

A B YES/NO 

0≤A,B<N

Constraints

N ∈ {10, 20, 30, 40}
k = 2
L ∈ {1,2,3,4} lies for each of the testcases respectively.

A minimum of (L + 1) * N/2 queries must be asked to Oracle before Neo makes a guess.
Any guess of color before that would result in loosing the game.

Output Format

Output 2 single spaced integers which serve as indices of the balls whose colors Oracle has to compare. When Neo is sure of the ball with the majority, output 1 integer which is the index of the ball whose color is the majority.

Sample Input

20 0 2 2 1
2
2 1 NO
3 4 NO

The 1st line says that there are 20 balls, majority exists, oracle lies exactly 2 times, and each ball has any of the 2 colors. 2nd says that two queries were asked to oracle. The 1st one was whether the balls indexed at 2 and 1 are of the same color or not and the Oracle’s reply was a NO and the 2nd one was whether the balls indexed at 3 and 4 were of the same color or not and the Oracle’s reply was a NO.

Sample Output

5 6

Neo wants to know whether the balls indexed at 5 and 6 are of the same color or not.

1

Neo answers that the ball indexed at 1 appears most in the set.

Task

Complete the function nextQuestion with takes in all the 5 integers, along with a 2-D array query where query[i][j] = 1 if a query

i j 

is asked and the Oracle says YES. The same value is set to 0 if the oracle says 0.

Note:- query[i][j] = query[j][i]

and the values is set to -1 if no query is asked for i and j.

Scoring

If M queries were asked to Oracle, on correct answer

M < (L + 1) * N/2, score = 0
M >= (L + 1) * (N-1), score = 1
(L + 1) * N/2 <= M < (L + 1) * (N - 1), score = ( (L + 1) * (N - 1) - M )/ 12

A minimum score of 1 is given for every correct submission.
