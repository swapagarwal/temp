Hip is a classic board game invented by Martin Gardner. It’s a 2 player game played on a 9x9 board. Players take turns placing a token on an unoccupied cell. The player who completes any square such that 4 corners are marked by his token loses. The square may be of any size and can be tilted at any angle. Here are a couple of game states that shows the players lose by completing a square.
