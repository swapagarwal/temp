Reversi is a board game for 2 players B and W who take turns placing black and white coins on an 8x8 board. The objective of the game is to flip as many of the opponent coins while blocking your opponent from flipping your coins. In order to flip a coin, you must first trap it between two of your coins, horizontally,vertically or diagonally. The game begins with four coins, two black and two white, placed in the center of the board.

Black goes first. The red dots in the image below indicate the possible positions of placing a coin by the current player. Black places a coin on the board in such a way that it traps one or more white coins between two of the black coins. This placement can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal as shown. When the black coin is placed, the white coins between the newly placed black coin is flipped over and becomes part of the black forces.
