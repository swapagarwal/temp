Installing the CAPTCHA Plugin
=============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the CAPTCHA plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf captcha-1.0-1.2.9.tar.gz

2) Decide if you want to store the plugin configuration file
   in the plugin directory or in the main SquirrelMail config
   directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the captcha directory, copy config_example.php
      to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
      you deem necessary.

     $ cd captcha
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the captcha directory,
      copy config_example.php to ../../config/config_captcha.php
      and edit ../../config/config_captcha.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cd captcha
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_captcha.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_captcha.php

3) Depending upon your backend selection, you may also want
   to review the backend configuration file as well.  Most
   backends do not require this step (try running 
   src/configtest.php to know for certain).  If you want to
   change any of the backend configuration settings, change
   to the backend directory of your choice, copy its example 
   configuration file and modify the copy.  Substitute the
   exact name of your backend selection in the following
   example:

  $ cd backends/<backend name>
  $ cp <backend name>_config_example.php <backend name>_config.php
  $ vi <backend name>_config.php

   Note that there are a few backends that may not have a 
   configuration file, in which case you should skip this step.

4) A few backends have an "images" directory that must be 
   readable and writeable by the web server.  See the backend
   requirements descriptions in the main CAPTCHA configuration
   file to know if your backend has that requirement.  If you
   choose one of those backends, remaining in the backend 
   directory, make sure the images directory has the correct
   ownership and permissions so that the web server has full
   access to it.  In a *nix style operating system, one way 
   to accomplish this is to obtain the name of the group that
   the web server runs under (in this example, we use "apache",
   but other common group names are "nobody", "http", "wheel",
   etc.):

  $ chgrp apache images
  $ chmod 770 images

5) If using the Lockout plugin to enable the CAPTCHA plugin 
   only when needed (after some number of failed login
   attempts), skip to step number 7.

6) Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and
   exit.

  $ cd ../../../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

7) If not being used with SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+,
   please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

8) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:
